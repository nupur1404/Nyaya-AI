8️⃣ Challenges & Learnings (Short Section)

So , One of the most challenging problem that i faced recently was while building Nyaya AI was during development, I noticed that users(by user I mean me and my team)
felt overwhelmed because the interface was cluttered and the flow was not intuitive. To fix this, I stepped back, mapped the full user journey, and redesigned the 
layout to make the experience simpler, clearer, and more human-centered. I tested the updated design and gathered feedback to refine tone, spacing, and overall clarity.
After these changes, the platform felt easier to navigate and more meaningful to interact with. This experience helped me grow not just as a developer, but as someone 
building technology for real people.
